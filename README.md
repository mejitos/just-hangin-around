# Just Hangin' Around

Little game of hangman where you can play with yourself or let the computer try to guess your word.

For now the game works on finnish words only and both versions of the game has hardcoded stuff all around it.
- CPU has hardcoded word length of 7 characters
- The normal version for now is pretty horrible but its somewhat playable
- Neither of the versions have any bugfixes or validations
- As a bonus there is big lists of finnish substantives, adjectives and verbs if someone needs them for something. Didn't find any from the internet so I made my own by scraping.
